The unique buffalo wing flavor had the perfect amount of heat and was packed with flavor. I hope they expand their distribution to more stores so that I can easily purchase them again. These chips have ruined all other chips for me!"

The combination of tangy barbecue and smoky mesquite flavors is simply irresistible. I find myself craving these chips at all hours of the day. Thank you for creating such an amazing snack!"
